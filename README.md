# FizzBuzzAlgorithm

Imagine a scenario where you are tasked with designing a program to analyze and process a single integer value. Your goal is to implement the FizzBuzz algorithm. The program should print "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3, "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5. For other numbers, it should print the number itself.

Write a Java program to implement the FizzBuzz algorithm for a given integer value.

Examples:
Input: 15
Output: FizzBuzz

Input: 8
Output: 8   

Input: 9
Output: Fizz

Input: 10
Output: Buzz
